<h2>Harry Potter and His friends</h2>
  <p>
    11. Draco Malfoy
    Draco and Harry were enemies pretty much from the moment they met. By the end of the series, they managed to get to sort of OK terms, but I doubt these two would ever hang out one-on-one voluntarily.
  </p>
  <p>
      10. Cho Chang
    Cho was more of a love interest than a friend, since Harry immediately had a crush on her. But ultimately, their romantic relationship didn't work out and they became friends instead. Though Cho was supportive of Harry's Dumbledore's Army efforts, she gets a lower ranker because she was rude to Hermione Granger. Don't diss the queen.
  </p>
  <p>
      9. Oliver Wood
    Though Oliver appreciated Harry's Quidditch skills, he was all too ready to risk Harry's health for the sake of winning. Not exactly BFF behavior. He was a better captain than best friend, if we're being honest.
  </p>
  <p>
      8. Fleur Delacour
    Fleur became a true ally to Harry after he "saved" her younger sister. She proved herself to be a truly caring person who supported Harry later in his fight against Voldemort. She and Harry probably wouldn't go chill at a pub together, but they are on good terms.
  </p>
  <p>
      7. Cedric Diggory
    Cedric and Harry's relationship was rocky from beginning to end, but in the end, both of them tried to do the noble thing. They were just two hero personalities who really weren't meant to be BFFs.
  </p>
  <p>
      6. Fred And George Weasley
    Harry had a great friendship with Fred and George Weasley, and they were basically the older brothers he never had. They gave him guidance (however mischievous), and gifted him the Marauder's Map. Harry gave them his Triwizard winnings without a second thought, and they always remembered and appreciated how he supported them.
  </p>
  <p>
      5. Neville Longbottom
    Harry kept Neville's secret about his parents, though Neville never knew he did. These two didn't hang out much, and perhaps both had to mature a bit, but in time Neville truly became one of the gang.
  </p>
  <p>
      4. Luna Lovegood
    I always loved Harry's friendship with Luna. They were outcasts together, bound by the ability to see Thestrals, but their friendship evolved beyond that. Harry was able to appreciate Luna for her eccentricities instead of being put off by them, and she brought out a new side of him. What a great pairing.
  </p>
  <p>
      3. Rubeus Hagrid
    Was there any friend more loyal and true than Rubeus Hagrid? He was kind and good-hearted, and even though he was a bit eccentric, he was always there for Harry. After all, Hagrid was Harry's very first welcome into the wizarding world, and because of his hospitality, Hogwarts truly became Harry's home.
  </p>
  <p>
      2. Hermione Granger
    She's pretty much the ultimate BFF. Hermione is loyal, trustworthy, and genuine, and Harry probably wouldn't have graduated Hogwarts without her homework help (scratch that, he definitely wouldn't have). She stayed by his side even through the grueling, difficult task of searching for the Horcruxes, and she displayed bravery worthy of both a BFF and a heroine in her own right. Though their friendship had a rocky start, it evolved into something beautiful.
  </p>
  <p>
      1. Ron Weasley
    Hermione is an amazing friend, but in Goblet of Fire it's clear that the thing Harry would miss most will always be his BFF: Ron Weasley. Ron is Harry's first true friend at Hogwarts, and even though they fight and Ron eventually leaves, Dumbledore knew the truth â€” Ron would always come back. These two are the ultimate best friends.
